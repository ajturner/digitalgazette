<h3>How to Write, Edit, and Contribute to Wiki Articles</h3>

<strong>Writing a New Article</strong>

<p>We’re thrilled you want to contribute your knowledge to the Wiki! Read below to learn how to write your own article from scratch or edit an existing article.
</p>

<p>
To write your own original wiki article, click on the link “Write A New Article” on the Wiki landing page highlighted below.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles1_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>On this page you’ll be able to tell us and other users about the article you’re writing. Start with a title, summary of the subject (one to two sentences), and tags (topics or places mentioned in your article like “agriculture” or “Upper Dir”). 
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles2_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>When you’re finished describing what you’re going to write, it’s time to get started! Click “Create Page” to begin writing your article.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles3_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>Within the writing pane, you can write and format your text. Type or paste in your article to the writing pane. To format, simply highlight your text and use the buttons (highlighted below) to bold, italicize, make lists, insert links, add pictures, or make paragraph headers.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles4_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>If you need some tips on formatting your article, click on the question mark “?” above the writing pane to open a formatting help window. 
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles5_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>When you’re all done writing and formatting your new wiki article, click “Save” at the bottom of the page to finish and post.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles6_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p> 
<strong>Editing and Contributing to an Existing Article</strong>
There are two ways to edit and add to articles. First, you can click the “Edit” link at the top of an article to view and have access to the full text of the article.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles7_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>After you click “Edit,” you’ll see a page that looks similar to the writing pane used when you want to write a new article. Within this writing and editing pane, you can add text, correct mistakes, or delete sections.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles8_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>Once you’re done making changes, click “Save” at the bottom of the page to save and publish your changes.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles9_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>The second way to edit an article is to focus on a particular section. If you hover your mouse near any heading, you should see the image of a pencil show up. Click on the edit pencil to open up that specific section for edits.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles10_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>In this mode, you can only change the text, not the formatting of an article. You can change text, delete, or write additional sentences or paragraphs in this section within the editing pane.
</p>
<%= image_tag("how/How to Edit Wiki Articles11_tn.png", :plugin => "digitalgazette") %>
<p>When you’re all done with that section, click “Save” to save and publish your changes to the article.
